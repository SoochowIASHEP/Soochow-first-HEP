	<h4 style="margin-top: 30pt;"> Introduction </h4>

<p class="p2" style="margin-top:-10pt;">		
Since 1997, the idea of holography has been considered as the key to approach the theory of quantum gravity. 
In the past few decades, the progress of understanding holography has been made in both the field theories and the dual gravitational theories. 
Supersymmetry makes many computation exactly calculable and comparable in both sides. 
People have already gained a lot of understandings about gravity from dual field calculation due to supersymmetry. 
The idea of this workshop is to bring people working in various fields together to share the most recent opinion and hopefully make it productive. </p>

<p class="p2">	 This workshop is aimed towards advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and active researchers in the field. 
We encourage students from all over the world to participate, and for domestic students we will try our best to provide financial supports to attend the workshop in person. 
</p>

<p class="p2">	 
The workshop will be held from August 8th to August 12th, 2022. 
Due to covid-19 pandemic situation, the workshop will be held online. 
</p>

<p class="p2">	 The 2022 Soochow workshop in High energy physics is generously supported by Soochow University and by the funds of Kosterlitz office in China.</p>

<p class="p2">	 The Institute for Advanced Study of Soochow University (SUIAS) is a newly founded research center with the long-term goal in fostering a creative research platform from which young scholars can grow as future academic and technological leaders of China. 
Prof. John Michael Kosterlitz works as the Honorary Dean of the institute.
